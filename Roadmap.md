# Project Plan for Team Melbourne's work on Discourse
 8 week roadmap outlined by Robin (@eviltrout) on the rgsoc'15 discourse page

Knowledge Required:

Javascript: This plugin will be heavy on the Javascript side and lighter on the Ruby side. We hope that our students can freshen up on the Javascript fundamentals before getting started. Going through the basics of Ember.js will also be helpful but I think we can learn enough to get through that if the Javascript basics are solid.

Loose Roadmap:

- Week 1 - Set up Discourse development environment
- Week 2 - Create basic "hello world" Discourse plugin
- Week 3 - Create Ad plugin: first step, shows boxes where ads should be on Discourse
- Week 4 - Separate boxes into an Ember component for re-use
- Week 5 - Add support for an ad provider to the component (Google? whoever is most popular!)
- Week 6 - Add site settings to configure plugin
- Week 7 - Create tests for plugin component
- Week 8 - Package plugin for Distribution
